### How to use
- Add new snippets as you learn.
- Keep examples **minimal** and **copyâ€‘pasteable**.
- Prefer `import ... as ...` aliases for speed.
- Put longer examples behind headings so GitHubâ€™s TOC (table of contents) works.

### Conventions
- Use a **consistent dataset variable** (e.g., `df` for DataFrame, `X`, `y` for features/labels).
- Prefer **pipelines** in scikitâ€‘learn.
- Keep TensorFlow examples short (build â†’ compile â†’ fit â†’ evaluate â†’ save).
